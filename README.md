# !Bang@Home

Faster Duck Duck go Bangs! in any browser... maybe even in no browser at all!


## How Use? 
All you need to do is download or copy the !Bang@Home.html file and click to open it and BOOM your banging in the comfort of your own home!

This janky solution allows for extremely fast loading. So its great for doing what i did and making a keyboard shortcut to auto open this file quickly at any time!
The possibilites are endless really use it how you want to! Customize it to your hearts content! No digging around files trying to figure out how the project works its just one file to rule them all!

If you dont want to download anything Bang@home also has a web version here: https://bangathome.free.nf/  
The site  offers  the same speed benefits of the standalone html file as well as an easy method to add edit or delete you own custom bangs which are then stored in the local cache of your browser.


**in order to be able to append search queries to bangs make sure to add '{{{S}}}' to the end of your links when adding them to the bangs manager. Look at bang.js for examples if needed.

Additionally you can also add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser. Enables all of DuckDuckGo's  and  your custom bangs to work, but much faster!

## How I Use?

I recommend and personally use the website version most. Its the most convenient way to get into banging at home.

## What R Bangs?

Bangs! are a really neat way of searching the internet made by DuckDuckGo.
They work by having a set list of mappings that allow you to type "!" followed by the first letter or two of a site and BANG it takes you to that site. The real neat thing is you can append queries to the end of the bangs so you can actually search within the site your naviagating to directly from the bang search! 

Example: say i want to search for Coffee Cups on amazon. Instead of needing to click to open a browser, type in amazon, then in amazon search for coffee cups,  I can simply open the Bang@Home File type "!a coffee cups" ... and it will  directly search amazon for coffee cups!

## Why Fork?

Am I better than theo? probably not but I want to try to do some cool stuff with this idea.

... Also didnt want to use t3 ai i like having !ai route to duck.ai

Benefits of this is YOU are in control of what the bangs are and how you use them! Make the local file your default browser,leave it on your desktop, make a keyboard shortcut  or add alias to your termial calling this file and now you have truly local bangs that you can change and add to whenever you want!

By default this file has all of the same bangs as the offical DuckDucGo Bangs, however simply open the file and scroll down to the custom bang array and now you can add bangs for whatever site you want! 

Custom Bangs are checked first so they overrided existing ones so no need to worry about a new bang you add getting blocked by some obscure site you never heard of. This also allows you to easily change bangs mappings for ones you dont find intuitive!

For example: Hate how !a opens Amazon? just add the link to apple.com to the custom bang array and make the alias a and BAM now typing !a opens apple.com!

This also like Unduck allows you to use bangs! with any browser or search engine not just DDG. Also unlike Unduck, this way means you dont need to change your default search engine to some random proxy site that you wont know will exist in a year or two or have to worry about someone changing the bangs on you. This is YOUR file I cant see anything you search and even if this project goes away you will always have your bangs! Use your browser and search engine of choice like normal but if you ever in the mood to bang! press cntrl + 1 (if you set up a shortcut like i did)  and youre banging in the comfort and security of you own household with no one to tell you you cant ;)

TLDR;
-Faster
-Better
-Harder
-Stronger
-Customizable
-Completely Private (its a local file you own)
-Will not wake up one day and decide you dont get to use it no more




## Why Fast?

DuckDuckGo Bangs are serverside this works client side!

!Bang@Home , forked from Unduck, Stores DuckDuckGo's bang mapping file locally and uses your chosen dns to resolve not theirs. 

## What Framework?
Framework? whats that? this project is held up by raw html, some javascript and an educated wish. Try to mess this up npm left-pad!!


## Extra
I will continue to add more features to this so if you like stay tuned...
